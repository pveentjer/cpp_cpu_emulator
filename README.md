# # CPU Emulator

A C++ program that emulates a bogus CPU instruction set. The goal of this project is to
upgrade my C++ programming skills while working on something I'm very passionate about.

The idea is to implement a micro-architecture in software with many of the modern CPU 
techniques like pipelining, out of order execution, store buffering, speculative execution,
register renaming. The actual instruction set for the time being is a fake one, but perhaps
in the future I'll pick ARM or X86 or something else.
