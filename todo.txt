TODO

- store buffer and memory, should be part of memory subsystem

- fix STORE

- fix STLF

- when printing cycle debug info: show some stats like total number of instructions issued, retired, ipc

- introduce an architectural register file

- better handling of the end of the program

- better modelling of the execution unit.

- super scalar (currently just 1 EU)

- should RS_Table be called RST (T stands for Table; just like RAT)

- program loader: should use R prefix for instructions

- pass program to load from the command line

- program loader: deal with loading literals

- program loader: should properly close file on error

- support speculative execution

DONE

- fix JNZ

- the solution with the NOPs to deal with HALT or a branch is not going to work if
  the latency to get an instruction through the pipeline is larger than the pipeline
  depth.
