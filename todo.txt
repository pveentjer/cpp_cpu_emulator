TODO

- when printing cycle progress, add the cycle as prefix

- the solution with the NOPs to deal with HALT or a branch is not going to work if
  the latency to get an instruction through the pipeline is larger than the pipeline
  depth.

- program loader: should use R prefix for instructions

- pass program to load from the command line

- program loader: deal with loading literals

- program loader: should properly close file on error

- support speculative execution

- super scalar (currently just 1 EU)

- out of order execution

DONE

- proper finding of a usable physical register.
