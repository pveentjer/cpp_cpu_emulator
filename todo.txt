TODO

- rename instruction to Operation

- introduce an architectural register file

- better handling of the end of the program

- better modelling of the execution unit.

- super scalar (currently just 1 EU)

- should RS_Table be called RST (T stands for Table; just like RAT)

- when printing cycle progress, add the cycle as prefix

- the solution with the NOPs to deal with HALT or a branch is not going to work if
  the latency to get an instruction through the pipeline is larger than the pipeline
  depth.

- program loader: should use R prefix for instructions

- pass program to load from the command line

- program loader: deal with loading literals

- program loader: should properly close file on error

- support speculative execution

DONE

- instruction queue should have constructor

- rs free stack logic should be moved into RS_Table

- out of order execution

- add RS_Table

- add ROB constructor/destructor

- proper finding of a usable physical register.
